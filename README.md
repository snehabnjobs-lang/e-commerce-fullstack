## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world e-commerce system with authentication, product management, cart flow, and order handling.  

The focus was on:

- Clean frontend architecture
- Reusable UI components
- Secure backend APIs
- Proper environment configuration
- Production-ready deployment

## 🧠 Architecture
Client (React) → Express API → MongoDB Atlas
│ │
Vercel Render


- Frontend and backend are deployed independently.
- Environment variables are isolated per service.
- RESTful API structure with JWT-based authentication.
